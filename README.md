# üçÉ Reroot's Task Scheduler üçÉ
## AKA 'GIS To Do List' üìù
### Project Overview

**Reroot Task Scheduler** is a project I developed during my internship at Reroot Pontiac, a organization dedicated to urban green infrastructure.  The application's primary purpose is to manage employee and volunteer tasks at several of their properties.  The task scheduler is a CRUD application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.  Additional features include task filtering, completion indicator and e-mail reminder.
